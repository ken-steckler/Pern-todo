npm init keeps track of all files in the application
express allows us to quickly creates a server in node
cors allows differernt domain applications to interact
- ex: serverr in localhost 5000 and react app in 3000

To get data from the client side, its from the req.body object

DB
- Schema to be specific on what is being put in DB
- Create separate database.sql to make it more visually appealing when writing commands.
\l = lists all databases
\dt = lists tables
\c database = go into a database
- db.js connects app to the database
- VALUES($1) - variable that will specify description ($1 is a placeholder), which is speicified in the second argument array.
- RETURNING * - used whenevever updating/inserting/deleting data
- WHERE to be specific on what data to GET (id for example)

js
- Async makes asynchronous requests easy
    - anytime getting data, it takes time. Async awaits function to complete before it continues.

React
- What's a Fragment?
- useEffect will help us make a fetch request to API every time a component is rendered
