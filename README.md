# ToDo App - PERN Stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node)
---
A todo list that lets users add, edit and delete a todo
---
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with how to interact with a SQL database, postgres.
## Challenge
Challenges: The biggest challenge was figuring out how to connect the local SQL database with the app.
---
## Next Steps
Since this project was done to simply familarize myself with how PERN works, I want to create a note taking application using similar principles.
